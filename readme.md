## Crunchyroll Downloader GUI

<img src="assets/example.png">

This is a cute GUI application that lets you download anime episodes from Crunchyroll. It was created with Electron, React, and Node.js.

### Features:
- Download anime episodes in mp4 format, and specify a quality (1080p, 720p, 480p)
- Download just the audio of an episode in mp3 format
- Download the m3u8 playlist (very fast, and still playable with the VLC player)
- Download all of the episode thumbnails in png format
- Download the subtitles of an episode (as a text file)
- Download all of the episodes in a season (detected by the link or if the search query has no numbers)
- Control the conversion process (pause, resume, stop, delete, etc.)

### Installation

Download the latest exe installer from the [releases](https://github.com/Tenpi/Crunchyroll-Downloader-GUI/releases) tab. Don't forget to
uninstall the app if you are going to update it (eventually I plan on integrating some auto-updating functionality). You may get a warning
message along the lines of "running this app can harm your PC", but don't worry because it's safe.

### Bugs and Requests

You can open an issue on my GitHub repository. I appreciate any requests, but I can't guarantee that I will fulfill all of them.
